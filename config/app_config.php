 *   Copyright (c) 2023 Government of Makueni County
 *
 *
 *   1. LICENSE TO RULE
 *   Welcome to the elite club! Crafted by the ingenious Martin Mbithi, this software comes with the all-powerful,
 *   revocable, personal, non-exclusive, and non-transferable right to install and activate this masterpiece on ONE  
 *   lucky computer for your official, non-commercial escapades. Got a commercial itch? Better get that license first. 
 *   No peeking, sharing, or showing off this software to anyone else—strictly against the rules!
 *
 *   2. COPYRIGHT POWER
 *   This software, a creation of Martin Mbithi under the banner of the Government Of Makueni DevSecOps Band, is guarded by 
 *   copyright law and international treaties. So, don’t even think about messing with the proprietary notices, labels, 
 *   or marks—what’s his stays his!
 *
 *
 *   3. USE IT RIGHT OR LOSE IT
 *   You may not, and you may not let your fellow geeks:
 *   (a) hack, reverse engineer, decompile, decode, decrypt, disassemble, or attempt any sorcery to reveal the source code;
 *   (b) modify, remix, distribute, or create spinoffs of this masterpiece;
 *   (c) make copies (aside from your trusty backup), distribute, show off in public, transmit, sell, rent, lease, or otherwise
 *   exploit this software like it’s yours. Spoiler: it’s not!
 *
 *
 *   4. GAME OVER, MAN!
 *   This license is your golden ticket until one of us says otherwise. Want to end it? Smash the software and all its copies into
 *   digital dust. Break any rules? The license self-destructs, and you’ll need to nuke all copies—no second chances!
 *
 *
 *   5. NO PIXEL-PERFECT PROMISES
 *   Martin Mbithi and the Government Of Makueni DevSecOps Band don’t guarantee this software is glitch-free—think of it as a feature
 *   not a bug! We disclaim all other warranties, whether expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability
 *   fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of third-party rights. Some jurisdictions have their own funky rules, so your mileage may
 *   vary. But remember: use at your own risk, brave user!
 *
 *
 *   6. KEEP THE PARTY GOING
 *   If a court zaps any part of this license, no worries—the rest of it keeps the party alive. One piece fails, but the agreement stands strong!
 *
 *
 *   7. NO DRAMA, NO DAMAGES
 *   Under no circumstances shall Martin Mbithi, the Government Of Makueni DevSecOps Band, or their minions be held responsible for any wild, indirect
 *   or accidental chaos from using this software—even if we warned you! And if you think you’ve got a claim, the most you’re getting is what you paid for the 
 *   license—if anything. Keep calm and code on!
